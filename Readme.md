# PPA(Pictorial Password Authentication)

## Problem Statement
>Alphanumerical passwords are required to satisfy two contradictory
requirements. They have to be easily remembered by a user, while they have
to be hard to guess by impostor.
Users are known to choose easily guessable and/or short text passwords,
which are an easy target of dictionary and brute-forced attacks.
Enforcing a strong password policy sometimes leads to an opposite effect, as
a user may resort to write his or her difficult-to-remember passwords on notes
thus exposing them to direct theft.
Other notorious password behaviours are:
(1) users share their passwords with their friends and colleagues,
(2) users fail to change their passwords on a regular basis even when
instructed to.
(3) users may choose the same password (or closely related
passwords) for multiple systems, and
(4) users are often willing to tell their passwords to strangers who asked for
them.

## Objectives
>The main objective of this project is to understand the difficulties faced by
people in remembering and entering the passwords.
▪ To ease out the process of storing complex passwords.
▪ To provide user multiple graphics leading to more security of storage.
▪ Familiarizing people with better solution to alphanumeric passwords.

Pictorial password authentication implemented in web-based system is an
alternative password that can replace the standard textual-based password.
The objective of the system that have achieved were to design a pictorial password
authentication implemented in web-based system.
Then to implement the pictorial password authentication using pass points
scheme. Finally, to test the effectiveness of pictorial password authentication
system using pass points scheme to authenticate users by using web system.
